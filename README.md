## Objectives of AA1
The objectives for AA1 are as follows:
1.	To understand the distribution of key attributes in the synthetic dataset created which will inform relevant data preprocessing steps needed.
2.	To predict customer churn in the e-commerce domain using tree-based classifiers. 
3.	To determine the best performing tree-based classifier for the use case of customer churn classification in the e-commerce domain.
4.	To improve my mastery over the use Talend Data Integration (DI), Talend Data Preparation (DP) and SAS Enterprise Miner (EM) tools in conducting an end-to-end data mining project for AA1 using the SEMMA methodology.
