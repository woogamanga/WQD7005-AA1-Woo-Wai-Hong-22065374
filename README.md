Data mining in e-commerce involves extracting valuable insights and patterns from large datasets to enhance decision-making processes within online retail environments. The benefits of data mining in e-commerce include improved customer segmentation, personalized recommendations, and optimized marketing strategies based on historical customer behaviour. Customer churn prediction is particularly crucial in e-commerce as it helps identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing businesses to implement targeted retention strategies and ultimately enhance customer loyalty and profitability.

## Objectives of AA1
The objectives for AA1 are as follows:
1.	To understand the distribution of key attributes in the synthetic dataset created which will inform relevant data preprocessing steps needed.
2.	To predict customer churn in the e-commerce domain using tree-based classifiers. 
3.	To determine the best performing tree-based classifier for the use case of customer churn classification in the e-commerce domain.
4.	To improve my mastery over the use Talend Data Integration (DI), Talend Data Preparation (DP) and SAS Enterprise Miner (EM) tools in conducting an end-to-end data mining project for AA1 using the SEMMA methodology.
## Role of Talend Data Integration (DI)
Talend Data Integration is an open-source ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool that enables organizations to connect, transform, and integrate data from various sources to meet their business needs.

The role of Talend DI in this assessment are as follows:
1.	To perform data integration on the 2 synthetic datasets, sales_data.csv and customer_data.csv, using tools in such as ‘tFileInputDelimited’, ‘tMap’, ‘tFileOutputDelimited’.
